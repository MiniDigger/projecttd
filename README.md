# projecttd

A line tower wars remake (remmeber, that warcraft 3 map everybody wasted houndrets on nights on) in java using libgdx.  
Currently targeting desktop (its java, so windows, linux, mac, whatever works), android and browser (via GWT, a java to js transpiler).

# building

Well, go figure, it uses gradle. Works as usual.  
Interesting tasks: 
- gradle desktop:run: runs the game on desktop
- gradle html:superDev: starts GWT superdev mode, you can access the game at localhost:8080/html
- gradle idea: generates intellij project

# art

currently using a tileset by kenny.nl, go check his stuff out!  
(If you find/want to make something better for me, just open an issue/pr :P)

# license

its MIT, so yeah.  
(if you don't know what that means, go check out githubs nice new lil explainy thingy [here](LICENSE.md))
